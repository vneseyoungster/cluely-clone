## Core Philosophy

You are Claude Code. I use specialized agents and skills for complex tasks.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Agent-First**: Delegate to specialized agents for complex work
2. **Parallel Execution**: Use Task tool with multiple agents when possible
3. **Plan Before Execute**: Use Plan Mode for complex operations
4. **Test-Driven**: Write tests before implementation
5. **Security-First**: Never compromise on security

## Modular Rules

Detailed guidelines are in `.claude/rules/`:

| Rule File | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| security.md | Security checks, secret management |
| coding-style.md | Immutability, file organization, error handling |
| testing.md | TDD workflow, 80% coverage requirement |
| git-workflow.md | Commit format, PR workflow |
| agents.md | Agent orchestration, when to use which |
| patterns.md | API response, repository patterns |
| performance.md | Model selection, context management |
| hooks.md | Hook configuration and registry |

## Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/cv:research` | Gather context, requirements, resolve conflicts |
| `/cv:plan` | Architecture, tasks, test specs (from research) |
| `/cv:build` | Implement, validate, generate test instructions |
| `/cv:review` | Code review, security audit, coverage check |
| `/cv:fix` | Bug fix with systematic-debugging |
| `/cv:refactor` | Safe refactoring: clean, rename, extract |
| `/cv:init` | New project wizard or scan existing |

## Personal Preferences

### Code Style
- No emojis in code, comments, or documentation
- Prefer immutability - never mutate objects or arrays
- Many small files over few large files
- 200-400 lines typical, 800 max per file

### Git
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`
- Always test locally before committing
- Small, focused commits

### Testing
- TDD: Write tests first
- 80% minimum coverage
- Unit + integration + E2E for critical flows

## Workflow

```
┌─────────────┐   ┌──────────┐   ┌────────────┐   ┌────────┐   ┌─────────────┐
│/cv:research │-->│ /cv:plan │-->│ /cv:build  │-->│ [test] │-->│ /cv:review  │
└─────────────┘   └──────────┘   └────────────┘   └────────┘   └─────────────┘
```

Quick reference:
- New project? -> `/cv:init`
- New feature? -> `/cv:research` -> `/cv:plan` -> `/cv:build` -> test -> `/cv:review`
- Bug fix? -> `/cv:fix {problem}`
- Research? -> `/cv:research {topic}`
- Clean up code? -> `/cv:refactor clean`

## Output Locations

| Document | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Session Root | `plans/sessions/{date}-{slug}/` |
| Research | `{session}/research/` |
| Plans | `{session}/plans/` |
| Code Changes | `{session}/code-changes/` |
| Reviews | `{session}/reviews/` |
| Build Summary | `{session}/build-complete.md` |

---

## Success Metrics

You are successful when:
- All tests pass (80%+ coverage)
- No security vulnerabilities
- Code is readable and maintainable
- User requirements are met

---

**Philosophy**: Agent-first design, parallel execution, plan before action, test before code, security always.
