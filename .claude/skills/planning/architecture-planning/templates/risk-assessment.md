## Risk Matrix Legend

### Probability Levels
| Level | Description | Likelihood |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **High** | Very likely to occur | > 70% chance |
| **Medium** | Could occur | 30-70% chance |
| **Low** | Unlikely to occur | < 30% chance |

### Impact Levels
| Level | Description | Effect |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **High** | Severe impact | Project failure, major rework, security breach |
| **Medium** | Significant impact | Schedule delay, partial rework, degraded experience |
| **Low** | Minor impact | Small delay, easy workaround, minimal effect |

### Risk Level Calculation

| Probability ↓ / Impact → | Low | Medium | High |
|---------------------------|-----|--------|------|
| **High** | Medium | High | **Critical** |
| **Medium** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Low** | Low | Low | Medium |
